## 🚀 What I Do

💡 **Core Focus Areas**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Building context-aware AI assistants using LangChain, FAISS, and LLMs.  
- **AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems:** Designing intelligent, tool-using agents with LangChain & LangGraph.  
- **Generative AI Applications:** Creating custom LLM-powered apps and deployable products.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Text classification, summarization, Q&A, and prompt engineering.  
- **Deep Learning:** CNNs, Transformers, and Fine-tuning models for vision & language tasks.  
- **Web + AI Integration:** Deploying AI systems using Streamlit, Flask, and MERN stack integrations.
