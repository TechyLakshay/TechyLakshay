# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hi there! I'm a passionate **AI Enthusiast** and **AI Engineer** with a strong foundation in **machine learning, NLP, and Python**. I enjoy building intelligent systems that can solve real-world problems. You’ll find some of my best projects here, ranging from **AI models** and **data-driven applications** to **interactive web apps**.

### 🚀 What I Do
I specialize in the following areas:
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Building predictive models and solving problems using advanced algorithms.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Working with transformers, text summarization, sentiment analysis, and more.
- **Deep Learning**: Leveraging frameworks like **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **Keras** to design neural networks for various tasks.
- **Data Science**: Using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** to clean, analyze, and visualize data.
- **Web Development**: Building full-stack apps with **MERN** stack and integrating AI capabilities using frameworks like **Streamlit**.

### 🧑‍💻 Featured Projects

Here are a few of my **highlighted projects** that I’ve worked on:

#### 1. [**NLP Multi-Tool with Transformers**](https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-multi-tool)
A **Streamlit app** that integrates multiple **NLP tasks** such as:
- **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
- **Text Summarization**
- **Translation (EN→FR)**
- **Question Answering**
All powered by **Hugging Face Transformers**, this project showcases a wide range of **AI capabilities**.

#### 2. [**PHISHGURD: Phishing URL Detection System**](https://github.com/yourusername/phishgurd)
A **machine learning-based project** designed to detect **phishing URLs** in emails using **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**. Achieved **95%+ accuracy**. This project emphasizes **AI for security** and showcases model deployment and optimization.

#### 3. [**Flask-AI Client-Server for Text Generation**](https://github.com/yourusername/flask-ai-client-server)
A **Flask-based server** that communicates with the **Ollama API** for **text generation** using **LLama3**. The client sends prompts to the server, and the server returns AI-generated responses. This project is a hands-on example of integrating **AI models** into a **client-server architecture**.
